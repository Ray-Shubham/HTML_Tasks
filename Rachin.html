<h1>Rachin Ravindra</h1>
<p>Rachin Ravindra was born in Wellington on 18 November 1999 to Hindu parents of South Indian origin from Bangalore. His father Ravi Krishnamurthy, a software architect, played club-level cricket in Bangalore before settling in New Zealand in 1997.[3][4] Rachin Ravindra's first name was reported to be a portmanteau of the first names of Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar,[5][4][6] but his father, while acknowledging the portmanteau, dismissed it as coincidence.[7] His grandfather Balakrishna Adiga is a renowned educationist in India.[8] Rachin began his cricket journey after being influenced by Sachin Tendulkar since childhood.[9]

Rachin Ravindra began playing cricket in Wellington at the age of five,[10] and traveled to Bangalore every year to play club cricket.</p>
