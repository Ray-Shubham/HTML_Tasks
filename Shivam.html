<p>Shivam Dube was born on 26 June 1993 in Mumbai, India. His father Rajesh Dube hails from Bhadohi district in Uttar Pradesh and had migrated to Mumbai for work.[4]

    Dube played school cricket for Hansraj Morarji Public School but had to stop playing at the age of 14 as he was overweight and unable to work on his fitness due to financial constraints. He returned to play at the age of 19 and was soon selected for the Mumbai Under-23s</p>
